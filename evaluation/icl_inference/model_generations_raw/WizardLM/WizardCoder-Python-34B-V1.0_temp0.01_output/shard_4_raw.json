The condition CONDITION_FLAG_E & CONDITION_FLAG_F is evaluated, which performs a bitwise AND operation between the values of CONDITION_FLAG_E and CONDITION_FLAG_F.

It then calls the calculate_suffix_properties function from a separate file newClass68207 with suffix and the count of the character in the text as arguments. The calculate_suffix_properties function simply returns the product of the two arguments. Finally, it performs a t-test on two lists of integers [92, 15, 85] and [12, 37, 77] using the ttest_ind function from scipy.stats, which also does not affect the result.

The function f is defined, which takes a single argument nums.\n4. The input list nums is copied using the slicing syntax nums[:] to avoid modifying the original list.\n5. The scipy.stats.ttest_ind function is called with the arguments [74, 95, 1] and [87, 88, 83], but this function is not defined in the code snippet, so we cannot determine its output.\n6. The prepend_elements function is defined inside f, which recursively inserts elements from the input list nums into the beginning of the list.\n7. The prepend_elements function is called with the arguments -4 (i), 0 (stop), and 1 (step).\n8. Since step is positive and i is less than stop, the function returns without doing anything.\n9.

However, we can see that the function returns a list with two elements, where the first element is a string in the format \"e oC\" and the second element is a string in the format \"final_temperature e\".\n\nAssuming that the temperature_calculation_func returns an integer value for final_temperature, we can assume that the output of f(1, 1234567890) will be \"1234567890 oC\" if final_temperature is greater than 1, and \"1234567890 1\" otherwise.\n\nSince the t-test is performed on two lists, we can assume that it doesn't affect the output of the function.\n\nTherefore, the output of f(1, 1234567890) is \"1234567890 oC\".\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]assert f(1, 1234567890) == \"1234567890 oC\""], "51": ["You are given a Python function and an assertion containing an input to the function.

It then returns the value of count, which is initially set to 0. The function uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the string s. If the bitwise AND of the variable ConditionChecker14 (311) and condition_value (945) is non-zero, it sets variable_3_11 to 1 and creates a new thread that calls the func function from a separate file newClass7235.py with variable_3_11 and count as arguments. The result of the function call is then stored in count.

The thread_func function is defined, which takes a queue as an argument and calls the func function from newClass7235.py with variable_3_11 (1) and count (0) as arguments.\n9. The result of the func function call is stored in result_func by using the queue.\n10. The worker_thread is joined, which means that the main thread waits for the worker_thread to complete before continuing.\n11. The value of count is updated to result_func.\n12. The loop continues to the next character in s.\n13. Since s.rindex(char) and s.index(char) are the same for each character in the string, the if statement is never executed.\n14.

The value 2 is passed as the third argument to f.\n9. The variable LoopChecker17 is assigned the value 134.\n10. The variable LoopChecker27 is assigned the value 133.\n11. The function recursively_shift_list_elements is defined inside f.\n12. The function recursively_shift_list_elements takes three arguments x, stop, and step.\n13. The function recursively_shift_list_elements is called with the arguments start - 1, 0, and -step.\n14. The if statement checks if step is 0 or if step is positive and x is greater than or equal to stop, or if step is negative and x is less than or equal to stop. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns without doing anything.\n15. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with x + step, 0, and -step as arguments.\n16. The function inserts the value of m at the index start in L.\n17. The function ttest_ind is called with the arguments [7, 90, 82] and [98, 56, 33].\n18. The function returns the modified list L.\n19. The function f is called with the arguments thigh_o_two[:], 3, and 2.\n20. The function recursively_shift_list_elements is called with the arguments start - 1, 0, and -2.\n21. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 1 in L.\n22. The function recursively calls itself with x + 1, 0, and -2.\n23. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 2 in L.\n24. The function recursively calls itself with x + 2, 0, and -2.\n25. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 3 in L.\n26. The function recursively calls itself with x + 3, 0, and -2.\n27. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 4 in L.\n28. The function recursively calls itself with x + 4, 0, and -2.\n29. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 5 in L.\n30. The function recursively calls itself with x + 5, 0, and -2.\n31. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 6 in L.\n32. The function recursively calls itself with x + 6, 0, and -2.\n33. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 7 in L.\n34. The function recursively calls itself with x + 7, 0, and -2.\n35. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 8 in L.\n36. The function recursively calls itself with x + 8, 0, and -2.\n37. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 9 in L.\n38. The function recursively calls itself with x + 9, 0, and -2.\n39. The if statement is false, so the function inserts the value of m at the index start - 10 in L.\n40. The function returns the modified list L.\n41. The function f returns the modified list L.\n42. The ttest_ind function is called with the arguments [7, 90, 82] and [98, 56, 33].\n43.

The function f is defined, which takes a single argument text.\n2. The variables threshold_1, ConditionChecker29, result, and loop_upper_bound are defined and initialized.\n3. The function ttest_ind is called with the arguments [45, 35, 95] and [85, 28, 46]. This function is not defined in the code, so we don't know what it does.\n4. The function insert_uppercase_chars is defined, which takes three arguments LoopIndexOut, stop, and step.\n5. The function insert_uppercase_chars is called with the arguments 0, loop_upper_bound // LoopChecker23, and 1.\n6. Inside insert_uppercase_chars, if the step is 0 or (step is positive and LoopIndexOut is greater than or equal to stop) or (step is negative and LoopIndexOut is less than or equal to stop), the function returns without doing anything.\n7. If the condition is not met, the function loops through each character in the text.\n8. If the character is uppercase, it is inserted into the result list at the middle index.\n9. The function is called recursively with the arguments LoopIndexOut + step and stop, and step.\n10. The function is called again with the arguments 1 and loop_upper_bound // LoopChecker23, and 1.\n11. The if statement checks if threshold_1 & ConditionChecker29 is true. Since threshold_1 is 981 and ConditionChecker29 is 532, the condition is true.\n12. If the length of result is 0, the result is set to ['-'].\n13. The function returns the joined values in the result list as a string.\n\nSince the function ttest_ind is not defined, we don't know what it does. However, we can assume that it doesn't affect the output of the function.\n\nAssuming the function ttest_ind doesn't affect the output, the function will insert uppercase characters into the result list and return the joined values as a string. The middle index is calculated as len(result) // 2, which is 0 for the first call, so the uppercase characters will be inserted at index 0.\n\nLet's assume the input text is \"String matching is a big part of RexEx library.\"\n\n1. The first uppercase character in the input is \"S\", so it is inserted at index 0 of the result list.\n2. The second uppercase character is \"R\", so it is inserted at index 1.\n3. The third uppercase character is \"E\", so it is inserted at index 1.\n4. The fourth uppercase character is \"X\", so it is inserted at index 2.\n5. The fifth uppercase character is \"R\", so it is inserted at index 2.\n6. The sixth uppercase character is \"E\", so it is inserted at index 3.\n7. The seventh uppercase character is \"X\", so it is inserted at index 3.\n8. The eighth uppercase character is \"L\", so it is inserted at index 4.\n9. The ninth uppercase character is \"R\", so it is inserted at index 4.\n10. The tenth uppercase character is \"E\", so it is inserted at index 5.\n11. The eleventh uppercase character is \"X\", so it is inserted at index 5.\n12. The twelfth uppercase character is \"L\", so it is inserted at index 6.\n13. The thirteenth uppercase character is \"E\", so it is inserted at index 6.\n14. The fourteenth uppercase character is \"B\", so it is inserted at index 7.\n15. The fifteenth uppercase character is \"R\", so it is inserted at index 7.\n16. The sixteenth uppercase character is \"E\", so it is inserted at index 8.\n17. The seventeenth uppercase character is \"X\", so it is inserted at index 8.\n18. The eighteenth uppercase character is \"L\", so it is inserted at index 9.\n19. The nineteenth uppercase character is \"E\", so it is inserted at index 9.\n20. The twentieth uppercase character is \"B\", so it is inserted at index 10.\n21. The condition len(result) == 0 is false, so the result list is not set to ['-'].\n22.

The function is decorated with a custom decorator my_decorator, which does not modify the behavior of the function. The function f initializes some variables and starts a new thread to perform some analysis. The while loop runs until the iteration_counter is not divisible by the termination_threshold (15 % 14 == 1, so it runs once). Inside the while loop, a new thread is started to perform the analysis, and the result is stored in a queue. The thread is joined, and the result is retrieved from the queue.

The function f takes two arguments, text and char, and performs some operations on them. The function process_data is called within f, but it is not defined in the given code snippet. The assertion at the end of the code is incomplete, so we cannot determine the output of the code. We can assume that the process_data function is defined in a separate file called newClass51795.py, which is imported at the beginning of the code. We can also assume that the process_data function takes two arguments and returns an integer value.\n\nThe code creates a new thread to execute the process_data function, which takes an input_data value of 1 and a loop_counter value of 32. The while loop runs until the loop_counter is no longer equal to 31, and the loop_counter is updated based on the result of the process_data function. The loop_counter is used as an index to find the position of char in the text string and append it to the list a.

The function ttest_ind is called with the arguments [82, 43, 56] and [72, 17, 5]. This is not important for the output, so we can ignore it for now.\n4. The variable LoopChecker18 is set to 842.\n5.

The function insert_signature_char is defined, which takes two arguments signature_index and stop.\n8. The function insert_signature_char is called with the arguments 0 and len(sign), and step is set to 1.\n9. The function insert_signature_char checks if step is 0 or (step is positive and signature_index is greater than or equal to stop) or (step is negative and signature_index is less than or equal to stop).

The function f is defined, which takes a single argument arr.\n5. The function f initializes an array of counts with 9 zeros, and an empty list ans.\n6. The function f iterates through each element in arr, and increments the count of the corresponding index in counts.\n7. The function f defines a nested function traverse_and_append, which takes three arguments (i, stop, and step).\n8. If step is 0 or (step is positive and i is greater than or equal to stop) or (step is negative and i is less than or equal to stop), the function returns without doing anything.\n9. If counts[i] is greater than 0, the function decrements counts[i] and appends i+1 to ans.\n10. The function traverse_and_append is called with i=0, stop=len(counts), and step=1.\n11. The function traverse_and_append is called recursively with i+1, stop, and step.\n12. The function f returns a tuple containing counts and ans.\n13. The function f is decorated with my_decorator using the @ syntax.\n14. The function f is called with the argument [6, 3, 0, 7, 4, 8].\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert f([6, 3, 0, 7, 4, 8]) == ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [7, 6, 3, 8, 4])\n"], "144": ["You are given a Python function and an assertion containing an input to the function.

The middle index of the text is calculated and stored in text_middle_index.\n4. The function append_left_half is defined, which takes three arguments i, stop, and step. It recursively appends characters to the result string from the left half of the text, starting from index i and going up to (but not including) the stop index, with a step of step.\n5. The append_left_half function is called with i=0, stop=text_middle_index, and step=1.\n6. The ttest_ind function is called with two lists of numbers, but it is not relevant to the output of the function, so we can ignore it.\n7. The variable LoopChecker115 is set to 248.\n8. The variable outer_loop_step is set to 247.\n9. The outer loop iterates outer_loop_step times, starting from 0.\n10. The append_right_half function is defined, which takes three arguments i, stop, and step. It recursively appends characters to the result string from the right half of the text, starting from index text_middle_index + len(text) - 1 - i and going down to (but not including) the stop index, with a step of step.\n11. The append_right_half function is called with i=text_middle_index, stop=len(text) - 1, and step=1.\n12. The result string is returned, padded with the last character of the text if necessary to have the same length as the original text.\n13. The function is called with the argument \"eat!\".\n14. The middle index of \"eat!\" is 2, so text_middle_index is 2.\n15. The append_left_half function is called with i=0, stop=2, and step=1. It appends the first two characters of \"eat!\" to the result string, so result becomes \"ea\".\n16. The append_right_half function is called with i=2, stop=4, and step=1. It appends the last two characters of \"eat!\" in reverse order, so \"t!\" is added to the result string, making it \"eat!t\".\n17.

Just give the final answer; Do not say if the two code snippets are semantically equivalent or not[/THOUGHT]Let's execute the code step by step:\n\n1. The function my_decorator is defined, which takes a single argument func.\n2. The function my_decorator shuffles the list [16, 87, 38] (which doesn't affect the program).\n3. The function my_decorator defines a new function dec_result, which takes any number of arguments (*args and **kwargs) and calls the original function func with them.\n4. The function dec_result returns the result of calling func with the given arguments.\n5. The function f is defined, which takes two arguments text and num.\n6. A queue_compute_function0 is created, which is used to store the result of the compute_function function.\n7. A worker_thread is defined, which takes a queue as an argument and calls the compute_function function with num and len(text) as arguments, and puts the result in the queue.\n8. A thread_compute_function0 is created, which runs the worker_thread with queue_compute_function0 as an argument.\n9. The thread_compute_function0 is started.\n10. The thread_compute_function0 is joined, which means that the main thread waits for the worker_thread to finish before continuing.\n11. The worker_result is retrieved from the queue_compute_function0.\n12. adjusted_length is set to the result of the compute_function call.\n13. text is centered with num number of asterisks (*) on both sides, and the resulting string is assigned to text.\n14. The ttest_ind function is called with the arguments [6, 75, 96] and [17, 53, 71], but this doesn't affect the program.\n15. The function returns the slice of text from the middle of the string, using adjusted_length // 2 as the start and end indices.\n\nSince we don't know what the compute_function does, we can't determine the value of adjusted_length, but we can assume that it is an integer.\n\nLet's assume that the compute_function returns 5:\n\n1. f('a', 19) is called with text = 'a' and num = 19.\n2. The queue_compute_function0 is created.\n3. The worker_thread is defined, which takes queue_compute_function0 as an argument and calls compute_function with num = 19 and len('a') = 1.\n4. The thread_compute_function0 is started.\n5. The thread_compute_function0 runs and puts the result of compute_function(19, 1) in the queue_compute_function0.\n6. The main thread waits for the thread_compute_function0 to finish.\n7. The worker_result is retrieved from the queue_compute_function0, which is 18 (assuming compute_function returns 5).\n8. adjusted_length is set to 18.\n9. 'a' is centered with 19 asterisks on both sides, resulting in '*********a*********'.\n10. The ttest_ind function is called with the arguments [6, 75, 96] and [17, 53, 71], but this doesn't affect the program.\n11.

It then starts a thread that calculates the result of the calculate_value function and stores it in a queue. The calculate_value function takes two arguments, whileloopchecker14 and newvariable_3_14_1, and returns their sum. The thread is started and joined, and the result is stored in calculated_value. The while loop runs as long as input_string starts with substring. The substring is then removed from the input_string. Finally, the ttest_ind function is called with the arguments [65, 13, 51] and [10, 78, 73]. The function returns the modified input_string.\n\nSince the while loop will never run, the input_string will not be modified, and the function will return an empty string. Therefore, the output of f('', 'A') will be an empty string.\n[ANSWER]assert f('', 'A') == ''"], "158": ["You are given a Python function and an assertion containing an input to the function.

The function parse_integer is defined, which takes three arguments: LoopIndexOut, stop, and step.\n6. The function parse_integer checks if the current value of LoopIndexOut is equal to stop, and if so, it returns without doing anything.\n7. If the step is 0, it also returns without doing anything.\n8. If step is positive and LoopIndexOut is greater than or equal to stop, or step is negative and LoopIndexOut is less than or equal to stop, it returns without doing anything.\n9. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with LoopIndexOut + step as the new value of LoopIndexOut.\n10. The function parse_digit is defined, which takes three arguments: i, stop, and step.\n11. The function parse_digit checks if i is equal to stop, and if so, it returns without doing anything.\n12. If step is 0 or (step is positive and i is greater than or equal to stop) or (step is negative and i is less than or equal to stop), it returns without doing anything.\n13. Otherwise, it updates the value of cur by multiplying it by 10 and adding the integer value of the character at index i in the string.\n14.

The function parse_digit updates cur to be 3 (the integer value of the first character in the string).\n19. It then calls itself with i = 1, stop = len(string), and step = 1.\n20.

If step is 0 or (step is positive and i is greater than or equal to stop) or (step is negative and i is less than or equal to stop), the function returns 'no'.\n11. If condition_flag_a & condition_flag_b is True (which it is, since 338 & 357 = 320, which is truthy), the function checks if the current letter is already in distinct_letters.\n12.

The function f is defined, which takes a single argument text.\n2. The function ttest_ind is called with the arguments [6, 15, 85] and [56, 30, 24]. This is a statistical test for independent samples, but we don't need to know the result for now.\n3. The variable total_prefix_length is initialized to 0.\n4. The variable loop_end is set to 550.\n5. The variable LoopChecker26 is set to 549.\n6. The function iterate_over_text is defined, which takes three arguments LoopIndexOut, stop, and step.\n7. The function iterate_over_text is called with the arguments 0, loop_end // LoopChecker26, and 1.\n8. Inside iterate_over_text, the condition is checked if step == 0 or (step > 0 and LoopIndexOut >= stop) or (step < 0 and LoopIndexOut <= stop). Since step is 1 and LoopIndexOut is 0, the condition is False, so the function continues.\n9. The function calculate_prefix_length is defined, which takes three arguments i, stop, and step.\n10. The function calculate_prefix_length is called with the arguments 1, len(text), and 1.\n11. Inside calculate_prefix_length, the condition is checked if step == 0 or (step > 0 and i >= stop) or (step < 0 and i <= stop). Since step is 1 and i is 1, the condition is False, so the function continues.\n12. The function rpartition is called on the text \"wdj\" with the argument 1, which splits the string at the first occurrence of the delimiter \"1\" and returns a tuple (before, delimiter, after). Since \"1\" is not found in the string, the tuple is (\"\", \"\", \"wdj\").\n13. The length of the first element of the tuple (before) is added to total_prefix_length, which is 0.\n14.

The function rpartition is called on the string \"wdj\" with the argument 2, which splits the string at the first occurrence of the delimiter \"2\" and returns a tuple (\"w\", \"2\", \"dj\").\n16. The length of the first element of the tuple (before) is added to total_prefix_length, which is 1.\n17. The function calculate_prefix_length is called again with the arguments i + step (2 + 1) and stop (len(text)), and step (1).\n18. The function rpartition is called on the string \"wdj\" with the argument 3, which splits the string at the first occurrence of the delimiter \"3\" and returns a tuple (\"wd\", \"3\", \"j\").\n19.

The function calculate_prefix_length is called again with the arguments i + step (3 + 1) and stop (len(text)), and step (1).\n20. The function rpartition is called on the string \"wdj\" with the argument 4, which splits the string at the first occurrence of the delimiter \"4\" and returns a tuple (\"wdj\", \"\", \"\").\n21. The length of the first element of the tuple (before) is added to total_prefix_length, which is 3.\n22. The function calculate_prefix_length is called again with the arguments i + step (4 + 1) and stop (len(text)), and step (1).\n23. The function rpartition is called on the string \"wdj\" with the argument 5, which splits the string at the first occurrence of the delimiter \"5\" and returns a tuple (\"wdj\", \"\", \"\").\n24. The length of the first element of the tuple (before) is added to total_prefix_length, which is 3.\n25. The function calculate_prefix_length is called again with the arguments i + step (5 + 1) and stop (len(text)), and step (1).\n26. The function rpartition is called on the string \"wdj\" with the argument 6, which splits the string at the first occurrence of the delimiter \"6\" and returns a tuple (\"wdj\", \"\", \"\").\n27. The length of the first element of the tuple (before) is added to total_prefix_length, which is 3.\n28. The function calculate_prefix_length is called again with the arguments i + step (6 + 1) and stop (len(text)), and step (1).\n29.

The function my_decorator is called with the argument f, so it is executed first.\n4. The my_decorator function calls the function f with the same arguments, and assigns the result to dec_result.\n5. The my_decorator function then returns the value of dec_result.\n6. The parse function is called with the argument '2024-10-23 15:21:30', but it is not used in the function.\n7.

The function f is decorated with this decorator, so it will be called with the same arguments and return the same value, but with additional functionality. The function f takes two arguments, nums and p, and returns an element from the nums list based on the value of a calculated index. The index is calculated using the scipy.stats.ttest_ind function and a constant_value of 1. The scipy.stats.ttest_ind function is called with the arguments [5, 89, 99] and [79, 55, 15], which are hardcoded values, and the result is stored in a queue. The worker_function function is defined inside f, which puts the result in a queue and starts a new thread to execute it. The thread is started and joined, and the result is retrieved from the queue. If the calculated index is negative, it is set to the length of nums minus 1. The function returns the element at the calculated index in the nums list.\n\nThe assertion at the end of the code is comparing the output of f([6, 8, 2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 7], 6) to a literal value.

The worker_function is defined and a new thread is created to execute it.\n5. The worker_thread is started and joined, and the result is retrieved from the queue.\n6. The result of calculate_value(1, 6) is 5, which is stored in the queue.\n7. The ConditionChecker129 and ConditionChecker229 variables are both 783, so the condition is True.\n8.

Just give the final answer; Do not say if the two code snippets are semantically equivalent or not[/THOUGHT]The code defines a decorator function my_decorator that takes a function as an argument and returns the same function unchanged. The function f takes a list of integers as input and returns a string containing the integers that appear at least 3 times in the list, separated by spaces. The process_data function is defined in a separate file newClass87170.py and is imported in the current file. It takes two arguments, a list and a number, and returns the product of the list and the number. The function f creates a new list temp_list with a single element 0, a variable variable variable_3_10 with the value 301, and a queue object. It then creates a new thread that runs the thread_function, which calls process_data with temp_list and variable_3_10 as arguments and puts the result in the queue. The thread is started and joined, and the result is retrieved from the queue and stored in processed_result. The function then initializes an empty list result_counts with the same length as processed_result and increments the count of each integer in the input list ints in the result_counts list. A recursive function recursive_filter is defined that adds the integer i to the result list r if it appears at least 3 times in the input list. The function is called with arguments 0, the length of result_counts, and 1. Finally, result_counts is cleared and the result list r is joined into a string and returned.\n\nLet's execute the code step by step:\n\n1. The function f is defined with a single argument ints.\n2. The decorator my_decorator is defined, which takes a function as an argument and returns the same function unchanged.\n3. The function f is decorated with my_decorator.\n4. The function f is called with the argument [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89].\n5. Inside f, a new list temp_list is created with a single element 0, a variable variable_3_10 is set to 301, and a queue object is created.\n6. A new thread is created with target thread_function and argument result_queue.\n7. The thread is started and joined.\n8. The thread_function is executed, which calls process_data with temp_list and variable_3_10 as arguments and puts the result in the queue.\n9. The result is retrieved from the queue and stored in processed_result.\n10. The length of processed_result is used to create a new list result_counts.\n11. The count of each integer in ints is incremented in result_counts.\n12. The recursive_filter function is defined.\n13. The recursive_filter function is called with arguments 0, the length of result_counts, and 1.\n14. The function recursive_filter is executed with i=0, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n15. Since step is positive and i is less than stop, the function checks if result_counts[0] is greater than or equal to 3.\n16. Since result_counts[0] is not greater than or equal to 3, the function is called again with i=1, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n17. The function is called again with i=1, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n18. The function is called again with i=2, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n19. The function is called again with i=3, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n20. The function is called again with i=4, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n21. The function is called again with i=5, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n22. The function is called again with i=6, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n23. The function is called again with i=7, stop=len(result_counts), and step=1.\n24. Since i=len(result_counts)-1, the function returns without adding any elements to r.\n25.

The function f is defined, which takes two arguments text and n.\n2. The function checks if n is less than 0 or the length of text is less than or equal to n. If either of these conditions is true, it returns the original text.\n3. If n is greater than 0 and the length of text is greater than n, it creates a new variable called substring that contains the first n characters of text.\n4. It creates a new thread that runs the function substring_thread_worker with the arguments substring_queue and variable_3_5.\n5. The function process_substring is called with variable_3_5 (which is 1) and len (which is a built-in function) and substring as arguments.\n6. The function ttest_ind is called with two lists of numbers.\n7. The while loop runs until loop_condition % loop_counter is equal to 1.\n8. The while loop inside the outer loop runs until i is less than or equal to 0.\n9. If the character at index i in substring is not equal to the character at the same index in text, it breaks out of the loop.\n10. The function returns the substring from the beginning of the string to the index i + 1.\n11.
