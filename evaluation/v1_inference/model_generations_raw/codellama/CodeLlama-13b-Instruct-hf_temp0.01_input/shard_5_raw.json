If it is not, it returns an empty list. \n\nThe function then defines a recursive function called recursiveTextProcessor. This function takes three arguments: loopIndex, stop, and step. It then checks if the loopIndex is less than or equal to the stop value, and if the step is greater than 0. If so, it inserts the character at the middle of the list. \n\nThe function then recursively calls itself with the loopIndex incremented by the step value. \n\nThe function then checks if the conditionalCheckValueOne and conditionalCheckValueTwo are both true.
