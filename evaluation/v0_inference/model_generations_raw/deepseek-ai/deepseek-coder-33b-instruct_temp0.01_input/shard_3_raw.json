The function also has several conditions that need to be met for the function to return a dictionary. \n\nThe conditions are:\n1. ConditionChecker19 & ConditionChecker29\n2. ConditionChecker17 & ConditionChecker27\n3. MINIMUM_LIST_LENGTH_DIFFERENCE & ConditionChecker25\n4. The lists must not be of the same length\n\nGiven the conditions, the function will return an empty dictionary if the lists are not of the same length. \n\nSo, to get the output {'a': ['car', 'dog'], 'b': ['car', 'dog']}, the input lists must be of the same length and the conditions must be met. \n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert f(['a', 'b'], ['car', 'dog']) == {'a': ['car', 'dog'], 'b': ['car', 'dog']}\n"]}, "raw_scored_generations": {"0": [false], "1": [false], "2": [false], "3": [false], "4": [false], "5": [false], "6": [false], "7": [false], "8": [false], "9": [false], "10": [false], "11": [false], "12": [false], "13": [false], "14": [false], "15": [false], "16": [false], "17": [false], "18": [false], "19": [false], "20": [false], "21": [false], "22": [false], "23": [false], "24": [false], "25": [false], "26": [false], "27": [false], "28": [false], "29": [false], "30": [false], "31": [false], "32": [false], "33": [false], "34": [false], "35": [false], "36": [false], "37": [false], "38": [false], "39": [false], "40": [false], "41": [false], "42": [false], "43": [false], "44": [false], "45": [false], "46": [false], "47": [false], "48": [false], "49": [false], "50": [false], "51": [false], "52": [false], "53": [false], "54": [false], "55": [false], "56": [false], "57": [false], "58": [false], "59": [false], "60": [false], "61": [false], "62": [false], "63": [false], "64": [false], "65": [false], "66": [false], "67": [false], "68": [false], "69": [false], "70": [false], "71": [false], "72": [false], "73": [false], "74": [false], "75": [false], "76": [false], "77": [false], "78": [false], "79": [false], "80": [false], "81": [false], "82": [false], "83": [false], "84": [false], "85": [false], "86": [false], "87": [false], "88": [false], "89": [false], "90": [false], "91": [false], "92": [false], "93": [false], "94": [false], "95": [false], "96": [false], "97": [false], "98": [false], "99": [false], "100": [false], "101": [false], "102": [false], "103": [false], "104": [false], "105": [false], "106": [false], "107": [false], "108": [false], "109": [false], "110": [false], "111": [false], "112": [false], "113": [false], "114": [false], "115": [false], "116": [false], "117": [false], "118": [false], "119": [false], "120": [false], "121": [false], "122": [false], "123": [false], "124": [false], "125": [false], "126": [false], "127": [false], "128": [false], "129": [false], "130": [false], "131": [false], "132": [false], "133": [false], "134": [false], "135": [false], "136": [false], "137": [false], "138": [false], "139": [false], "140": [false], "141": [false], "142": [false], "143": [false], "144": [false], "145": [false], "146": [false], "147": [false], "148": [false], "149": [false], "150": [false], "151": [false], "152": [false], "153": [false], "154": [false], "155": [false], "156": [false], "157": [false], "158": [false], "159": [false], "160": [false], "161": [false], "162": [false], "163": [false], "164": [false], "165": [false], "166": [false], "167": [false], "168": [false], "169": [false], "170": [false], "171": [false], "172": [false], "173": [false], "174": [false], "175": [false], "176": [false], "177": [false], "178": [false], "179": [false], "180": [false], "181": [false], "182": [false], "183": [false], "184": [false], "185": [false], "186": [false], "187": [false], "188": [false], "189": [false], "190": [false], "191": [false], "192": [false], "193": [false], "194": [false], "195": [false], "196": [false], "197": [false], "198": [false], "199": [false]}, "pass_at_1": 0.0, "pass_at_5": 100.0}
