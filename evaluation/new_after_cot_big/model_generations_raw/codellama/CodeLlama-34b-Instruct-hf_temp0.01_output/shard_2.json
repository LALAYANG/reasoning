The function my_decorator is defined, which takes a single argument func.\n2. The function my_decorator returns a new function called dec_result.\n3. The function dec_result is defined, which takes any number of arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n4. The function dec_result calls the function func with the arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n5. The function dec_result returns the result of calling func.\n6. The function f is defined, which takes two arguments l1 and l2.\n7. The function f imports the function ttest_ind from the module scipy.stats.\n8. The function f defines several variables: ConditionChecker19, ConditionChecker29, ConditionChecker17, ConditionChecker27, MINIMUM_LIST_LENGTH_DIFFERENCE, and ConditionChecker25.\n9. The function f calls the function ttest_ind with the arguments [95, 56, 26] and [88, 45, 56].\n10. The function f checks if ConditionChecker19 and ConditionChecker29 are both true.\n11. The function f checks if ConditionChecker17 and ConditionChecker27 are both true.\n12. The function f checks if MINIMUM_LIST_LENGTH_DIFFERENCE and ConditionChecker25 are both true.\n13. The function f checks if the length of l1 is not equal to the length of l2.\n14. If any of the conditions are not met, the function f returns an empty dictionary.\n15. If all the conditions are met, the function"]}
