The function f is defined, which takes a single argument ints.\n2. The function creates a list called counts with 301 elements, all initialized to 0.\n3. The function loops through each element in the input list, and increments the corresponding element in the counts list by 1.\n4. The function then creates an empty list called r.\n5. The function loops through each element in the counts list, and checks if the count for that element is greater than or equal to 3.\n6. If the count is greater than or equal to 3, the function appends the string representation of that element to the r list.\n7. After the loop completes, the function clears the counts list to free up memory.\n8. Finally, the function returns a space-separated string of all the elements in the r list.\n9. The function is called with the input list [2, 3, 5, 2, 4, 5, 2, 89], so the counts list will look like this: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,"], "196": ["True"], "197": ["'b'"], "198": ["(True, True)"], "199": ["{'a': 'car', 'b': 'dog'}"]}, "raw_scored_generations": {"0": [false], "1": [true], "2": [false], "3": [false], "4": [true], "5": [true], "6": [false], "7": [false], "8": [false], "9": [false], "10": [true], "11": [true], "12": [true], "13": [true], "14": [true], "15": [false], "16": [false], "17": [false], "18": [false], "19": [true], "20": [false], "21": [false], "22": [false], "23": [false], "24": [false], "25": [true], "26": [true], "27": [false], "28": [false], "29": [true], "30": [false], "31": [true], "32": [false], "33": [false], "34": [true], "35": [false], "36": [true], "37": [false], "38": [true], "39": [true], "40": [false], "41": [false], "42": [true], "43": [false], "44": [false], "45": [false], "46": [true], "47": [true], "48": [true], "49": [true], "50": [false], "51": [false], "52": [true], "53": [false], "54": [true], "55": [false], "56": [false], "57": [false], "58": [false], "59": [false], "60": [false], "61": [false], "62": [false], "63": [false], "64": [true], "65": [true], "66": [false], "67": [false], "68": [false], "69": [false], "70": [true], "71": [true], "72": [false], "73": [false], "74": [false], "75": [true], "76": [false], "77": [false], "78": [false], "79": [false], "80": [true], "81": [true], "82": [true], "83": [true], "84": [false], "85": [true], "86": [true], "87": [true], "88": [false], "89": [true], "90": [true], "91": [false], "92": [false], "93": [false], "94": [true], "95": [true], "96": [true], "97": [false], "98": [false], "99": [false], "100": [false], "101": [false], "102": [false], "103": [false], "104": [true], "105": [false], "106": [true], "107": [false], "108": [false], "109": [false], "110": [false], "111": [false], "112": [true], "113": [false], "114": [false], "115": [true], "116": [true], "117": [false], "118": [false], "119": [true], "120": [true], "121": [false], "122": [false], "123": [false], "124": [false], "125": [false], "126": [false], "127": [false], "128": [false], "129": [true], "130": [false], "131": [true], "132": [true], "133": [true], "134": [false], "135": [false], "136": [false], "137": [false], "138": [false], "139": [false], "140": [false], "141": [true], "142": [false], "143": [false], "144": [true], "145": [false], "146": [true], "147": [false], "148": [false], "149": [false], "150": [false], "151": [false], "152": [true], "153": [false], "154": [false], "155": [false], "156": [false], "157": [true], "158": [true], "159": [false], "160": [true], "161": [false], "162": [false], "163": [true], "164": [true], "165": [true], "166": [true], "167": [false], "168": [true], "169": [true], "170": [true], "171": [false], "172": [false], "173": [false], "174": [false], "175": [true], "176": [false], "177": [false], "178": [false], "179": [false], "180": [false], "181": [false], "182": [false], "183": [false], "184": [true], "185": [true], "186": [true], "187": [false], "188": [false], "189": [true], "190": [false], "191": [false], "192": [true], "193": [true], "194": [true], "195": [false], "196": [false], "197": [false], "198": [false], "199": [false]}, "pass_at_1": 37.0, "pass_at_5": 100.0}
