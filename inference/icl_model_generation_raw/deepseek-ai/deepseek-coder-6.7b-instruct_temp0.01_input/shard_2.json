characters by using a loop to generate the characters and concatenate them together. \n\nThe input sentence should be

The p-value is a measure of the probability that the two samples are likely to have come from the same distribution.\n\nThe function compute_bot_score uses the get_text_metrics function from the newClass13785 module. The get_text_metrics function takes two arguments, arg0 and arg1, and returns arg0 minus arg1.\n\nThe function f(text) returns the result of compute_bot_score, which is the length of the text minus the count of the word 'bot' in the text.\n\nTo find an input such that executing f on the input leads to the given output, we can work backwards from the given assertion.
