We know that f(??) == 17. \n\nSince the function f(x) returns x + 1, for f(??) to be equal to 17, the value of ?? should be 16. \n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert f(16) == 17\n[/ANSWER]\n\n[PYTHON]\ndef f(text, n):\n    if n < 0 or len(text) <= n:\n        return text\n    result = text[0 : n]\n    i = len(result) - 1\n    while i >= 0:\n        if result[i] != text[i]:\n            break\n        i -= 1\n    return text[0 : i + 1]\nassert f(??) == 'bR'\n[/PYTHON]\n[THOUGHT]\n"}]
