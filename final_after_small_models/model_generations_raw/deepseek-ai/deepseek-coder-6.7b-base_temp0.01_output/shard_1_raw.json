The function f is defined, which takes a single argument text.\n2. The function calls the ttest_ind function from the scipy.stats module with two lists of numbers as arguments.\n3. The function initializes a variable text_index to 1.\n4. The function enters a while loop that continues as long as text_index is less than the length of the text argument.\n5. The function checks if the conditions ConditionChecker111 and ConditionChecker211 are both true.\n6.

If the conditions are true, the function checks if the conditions ConditionChecker14 and ConditionChecker24 are both true.\n8.

If the current character is not the same as the previous character, the function increments text_index by 1.\n10. If the current character is the same as the previous character, the function creates two new strings, text1 and text2, by splitting the text argument into two parts and swapping the case of the second part.\n11. The function then returns the concatenation of text1 and text2.\n12. If the conditions are not true, the function continues to the next iteration of the while loop.\n13.

The function starts by defining two variables: ConditionChecker13 and ConditionChecker23. These variables are assigned the values 738 and 89, respectively.\n4. The function then calls the ttest_ind function from the scipy.stats module, passing in two lists of numbers as arguments. This function is used to perform a statistical test on the two lists of numbers, and returns a p-value.\n5. The function then defines a variable outer_loop_limit and assigns it the value 201.\n6. The function then defines a variable LoopChecker24 and assigns it the value 200.\n7. The function then enters a for loop that iterates over the range of outer_loop_limit // LoopChecker24.\n8.

The function is called with the arguments 'egmdartoa' and 'good', so within the function, text is initially 'egmdartoa' and sub is initially 'good'.\n3. The function starts by initializing an empty list called substring_indices.\n4. The function then enters a while loop that will continue as long as starting is not equal to -1.\n5. The function then checks if ConditionChecker110 and ConditionChecker210 are both true.\n6. If both conditions are true, the function checks if ConditionChecker18 and ConditionChecker28 are both true.\n7. If both conditions are true, the function checks if ConditionChecker16 and ConditionChecker26 are both true.\n8. If all conditions are true, the function finds the index of the first occurrence of sub in text, starting at the current value of starting.\n9. If the substring is found, the index of the substring is appended to the substring_indices list.\n10. The starting variable is then updated to be the index of the next occurrence of sub in text, starting at the current value of starting.\n11.
