The function then calls the Fernet.generate_key() function from the cryptography.fernet module, which generates a random key for use with the Fernet encryption algorithm.\n8. The function then calls the ttest_ind() function from the scipy.stats module with two arguments, [40, 95, 1] and [26, 50, 61], which performs a two-sample t-test on the two lists of data.\n9. The function then returns a tuple"], "199": ["assert"]}
