The function my_decorator is defined, which takes a single argument func.\n2. The function is called with the argument f, so within the function, func is initially f.\n3. Inside the function, the shuffle function from the sklearn.utils module is called with the argument [78, 78, 98].\n4. The function then defines a new function dec_result that takes any number of positional arguments (*args) and any number of keyword arguments (**kwargs).\n5. The function dec_result calls the function func with the same arguments (*args, **kwargs) and returns the result.\n6. The function my_decorator returns the function dec_result.\n7. The function f is defined, which takes a single argument strings.\n8. The function is decorated with the my_decorator decorator, which means that the function f is passed as an argument to the my_decorator function, and the result of the my_decorator function is assigned to the variable f.\n9. The function f is called with the argument [\"La\", \"Q\", \"9\", \"La\", \"La\"].\n10. Inside the function, the occurances dictionary is initialized.\n11. The datetime.datetime.now() function is called, which returns the current date and time.\n12. The ConditionChecker14 and second_condition variables are initialized with the values 383 and 481, respectively.\n13. A for loop is used to iterate over each substring in the strings list.\n14. Inside the for loop, the & operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation between ConditionChecker14 and second_condition.\n15. If the result of the bitwise AND operation is True, the if statement is executed.\n16. The if statement checks if the substring is not in the occurances dictionary.\n17. If the substring is not in the occurances dictionary, the substring is added to the occurances dictionary with the value of strings.count(substring).\n18.
