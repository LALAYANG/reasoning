The string b is created by repeating the string '104' t times, where t is the number of digits in n that are 0. The string b is then followed by the integer n itself.\n\nThe function also contains several conditions that are checked for each digit in n. If any of these conditions are met, the function breaks and returns the current value of b.\n\nTo find an input such that the function returns a specific string, we need to find an integer n such that the function returns '372359'. \n\nWe can start by trying to find the value of n that makes the function return '372359' by checking each possible value of n. However, this would be very time-consuming. \n\nInstead, we can try to find a pattern in the function. For example, we can notice that the function always adds '104' to b for each digit in n that is 0. This suggests that the number of times '104' is added to b is equal to the number of digits in n that are 0.\n\nWe can use this information to find a possible value of n. We know that the function returns '372359' when n is 372359. So, we can try n = 372359.\n\nThis would be a good starting point, but we still need to check the conditions in the function to make sure that n is a valid input.\n\nWe can also try to simplify the function by removing the conditions and just looking at the structure of the function. We can see that the function adds '104' to b for each digit in n that is 0. So, if we want the function to return '372359', we need to make sure that n has 3 zeros in it.\n\nWe can try n = 100000.

/home/yang/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/vllm/model_executor/model_loader/weight_utils.py:425: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.
